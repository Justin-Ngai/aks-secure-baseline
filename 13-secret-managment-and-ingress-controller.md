# Deploy AKS Ingress Controller with Azure Key Vault integration

Previously you have configured [workload prerequisites](./12-workload-prerequisites.md). These steps configure Traefik, the AKS ingress solution used in this reference implementation, so that it can securely expose the web app to your Application Gateway.

## Expected results

## Steps

1. _From your Azure Bastion connection_, ensure Flux has created the following namespace.

   ```bash
   cd ../workload
   kubectl get namespace a0005
   ```

1. _From your Azure Bastion connection_, deploy traefik

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -k .
   ```

secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-azure).

   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
   kind: SecretProviderClass
   metadata:
     name: aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls-secret-csi-akv
     namespace: a0008
   spec:
     provider: azure
     parameters:
       usePodIdentity: "true"
       keyvaultName: "${KEYVAULT_NAME}"
       objects:  |
         array:
           - |
             objectName: traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls
             objectAlias: tls.crt
             objectType: cert
           - |
             objectName: traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls

   ```


### Pass all workload images through quarantine


1. Install the Traefik Ingress Controller

   > Install the Traefik Ingress Controller; it will use the mounted TLS certificate provided by the CSI driver, which is the in-cluster secret management solution.

   > If you used your own fork of this GitHub repo, update the one `image:` value in [`traefik.yaml`](./workload/traefik.yaml) to reference your container registry instead of the default public container registry and change the URL below to point to yours as well.

   :warning: Deploying the traefik `traefik.yaml` file unmodified from this repo will be deploying your workload to take dependencies on a public container registry. This is generally okay for learning/testing, but not suitable for production. Before going to production, ensure _all_ image references are from _your_ container registry or another that you feel confident relying on.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mspnp/aks-secure-baseline/main/workload/traefik.yaml
   ```

1. Wait for Traefik to be ready

   > During Traefik's pod creation process, AAD Pod Identity will need to retrieve token for Azure Key Vault. This process can take time to complete and it's possible for the pod volume mount to fail during this time but the volume mount will eventually succeed. For more information, please refer to the [Pod Identity documentation](https://github.com/Azure/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-azure/blob/master/docs/pod-identity-mode.md).

   ```bash
   kubectl wait --namespace a0008 --for=condition=ready pod --selector=app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik-ingress-ilb --timeout=90s
   ```
